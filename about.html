                <p>I am Kevin Floyd, a computer science graduate from Troy University. I currently live in Alabama at
                    the moment. After finishing college I moved to Shanghai and forgot a lot of what I know about
                    programming. Since moving back due to Covid-19 I have recently been working to restart my coding
                    journey by relearning old and new
                    skills. I love the feeling that with programming, if there is anything that you can think of you can
                    create it at your fingertips. I hope to find a job where I can use my skills and continuously grow
                    professionally and personally. I am confident, hard-working and I love laughing and cultivating
                    relationships with coworkers and friends. When I am not practicing programming I enjoy playing video
                    games, traveling and reading. Please feel free to take a look at my projects and contact me if you
                    are interested. Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio.</p>
