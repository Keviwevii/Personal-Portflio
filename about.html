                <p>Hi I'm Kevin Floyd, a computer science graduate from Troy University and meme enthusiast from alabama. After finishing college I moved to Shanghai and currently I am rebuilding my programming skills. I have recently gotten the responsive web design certification from FreeCodeCamp. Althought I do not prefer web developemt, I am fairly good with HTML/CSS and I also have experience working with JavaScript but I really want to get into game design or data science one day. I am on the second round of the #100DaysofCode challange working with Python right now. So far my favorite thing to make with Python are gui applications. I am following a course on Python and using project-based learning to my advantage.</p>
                <p>I love the feeling that with programming, if there is anything that you can think of you can
                    create it at your fingertips. I hope to find a job where I can use old skills and new ones to grow professionally and personally. I am confident, hard-working and I love laughing and cultivating
                    relationships with coworkers and friends. When I am not practicing programming I enjoy playing video
                    games, traveling and reading. Please feel free to take a look at my projects and contact me if you
                    are interested. Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio.</p>
