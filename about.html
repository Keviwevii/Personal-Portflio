                <p>Hi I'm Kevin Floyd, a computer science graduate from Troy University, aspiring Pythonista and meme enthusiast. After finishing college I moved to Shanghai for a while and after moving back due to Covid I am rebuilding my programming skills. I have recently gotten the responsive web design certification from FreeCodeCamp. Althought I do not prefer web developemt, I am good with HTML/CSS and I also have experience working with JavaScript but I really want to get into game design or data science one day. I am on my second round of the #100DaysofCode challange working with Python for this round. So far my favorite things to make with Python are GUI applications. I am following a course on Python and using project-based learning to help learn more about the language and everything that it is capable of.</p>
                <p>I love the feeling that with programming, if there is anything that you can think of you can
                    create it at your fingertips. I hope to find a job where I can use old skills and new ones to grow professionally and personally. I am confident, hard-working and I love laughing and cultivating
                    relationships with coworkers and friends. When I am not practicing programming I enjoy playing video
                    games, traveling and reading. Please feel free to take a look at my projects and contact me if you
                    are interested. Thank you so much for viewing my portfolio.</p>
